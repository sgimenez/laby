Laby
====

Laby is a easy to use IDE to program a rock carrying ant-robot trapped in a
maze. Usually there is a door the robot wants to reach, but before that, it
needs to sort out several traps on his way. Help the robot by writing a
program that guides it out of the maze. Even if you have not programmed
before this is a great game to start. Help the robot and you will learn to
write programs at the same time, in several languages: ruby, pascal, perl,
ocaml, and java. We use mini-versions of the mentioned languages, but you
will still learn the fundamental of loops, conditionals and functions and you
will have fun while doing that.

Enjoy!

Example
-------

Here is a code example and everything you need for Ruby, let us know if
you want this example in the other languages too. It is the solution of
the level 2b. We are planning adding a lot of levels and some AI for 
complex path finding.


	require "./robot"

	# Level 2a
	#   ....+....1....
	# 1 +-------------
	# . |a           d
	# . +-------------
	# a = Ant Robot
	# d = Door
	#
	# Help:
	#
	# Constants:
	#   Void
	#   Rock
	#   Web
	#
	# Basic Movement:
	#   forward
	#   left
	#   right
	#   escape - open door
	#
	# Rocks:
	#   take - take rock in front
	#   drop - drop rock to front
	#
	# Loops:
	#   while look() == Void
	#     ...
	#   end
	#
	# Conditionals:
	#   if look() == Web
	#      ...
	#   else
	#      ...
	#   end
	#
	# Functions:
	#   def f
	#     ...
	#   end

	# Example Code to solve Level 2b:
	class Ant < Robot
	  def ant
	    while look() == Void
	      forward
	    end
	    escape
	  end
	end

	Ant.new
