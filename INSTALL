Linux:

  To compile laby, you need ocaml >= 3.10.0 and lablgtk >= 2.14.0
  (with support for gtksourceview >= 2.10).

  Execute the following commands in the archive main directory:

    make
    ln -s ${PWD}/data ${HOME}/.config/laby

  If you want the program to produce some kind of absurd sounds, make
  sure the alsa "aplay" command is present on your system.

  Now to run laby type:

    ./laby


Windows:

  The best advice is to use pre-compiled binaries available on the web:
    http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~gimenez/laby
  Those binaries are cross-compiled using mingw-ocaml.
  If you plan to compile them by yourself on windows, you will
  probably need patience and a lot of good luck and the following
  software:

    - ocaml >= 3.10.0 :
        http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
    - lablgtk >= 2.14.0 :
        http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
    - gtksourceview >= 2.10 :
        http://projects.gnome.org/gtksourceview/download.html
